# Maze-Generator

An application developed using C# and MonoGame which creates procedurally-generated mazes using Dijkstra's pathfinding algorithm.

The color of each of the maze 'tiles' are created by blending together two colors depending on how close the tile is to the origin of the maze. 
Can be used to create procedural art by generating big mazes and removing the walls - see the 'Examples' folder.
