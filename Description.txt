A random maze generator inspired by this Gamasutra post -http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/LaurentVictorino/20141202/231321/Mazes_hidden_beauty.php
The color of each of the maze 'tiles' are created by blending together two colors depending on how close the tile is to the origin of the maze. 
Can be used to create procedural art by generating big mazes and removing the walls - see the 'Examples' folder
Controls for altering the properties of the maze should be visible on the screen - if not, try pressing 'Q'.
Tends to look best when the two colors clash - each color can be changed using 'X' and 'Z'.

Demonstrates proficiency in using C#, Visual Studio and MonoGame.
